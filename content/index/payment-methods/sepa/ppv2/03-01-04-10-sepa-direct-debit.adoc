[#PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_General]
=== General Information

This is a reference page for _SEPA Direct Debit_. Here you find all the information necessary for integrating this payment method into your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with {payment-page-v2} ({payment-page-v2-abbr})?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides (<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>, <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPv2, {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, common process flow>> for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for the available transaction type <<PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>>, including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not use real information.

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the  <<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> section.

For response verification examples, see the <<PPSolutions_PPv2_PPv2Security, {payment-page-v2-abbr} Security>> section.


[#PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_About]
=== About _SEPA Direct Debit_

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is an initiative of the European banking industry that makes electronic payments across the euro area as easy as domestic payments within one country. The payments are processed under the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations regardless of their location.

SEPA Direct Debit is a payment method which authorizes a transaction before it transfers money from the consumer account to you.


[#PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_TestCredentials]
=== Test Credentials

[NOTE]
====
The {payment-provider-name} test environment is not connected to SEPA. We cannot validate SEPA specific data such as IBAN, BIC, Creditor ID, etc. It is only possible to check whether the *structure of a request* is valid. In the test environment you can only simulate a 'success' or 'cancel' scenario. You cannot simulate a 'fail' scenario.

[#PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_TransactionType_debit]
=== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the specified amount from the account holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You find them below.

<<PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _SEPA Direct Debit_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the payment form.

[#PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_RecurringTransactions]
=== Recurring Transactions

Use {payment-page-v2-abbr} to create the first transaction in a series of recurring
transactions. Then use our <<RestApi, REST API>> for all the following transactions (these need to reference the
first one).

To register an initial (first) recurring transaction, use a normal debit
request (like the one in the example above) and add these two fields:

- ``periodic-type`` , set to value ``recurring`` or ``installment``.
- ``sequence-type`` , set to value ``first``.

//-

The periodic and sequence information indicates that this is the first
transaction in a series. There are no other requirements for the
request.

The ``provider-transaction-reference-id`` returned in the
response contains the ID used to reference all transactions belonging to
a specific recurring group.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

[#PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_B2BScheme]
=== B2B Scheme

To use the SEPA B2B scheme for Direct Debit, add the ``b2-b`` field to the
request and set its value to ``true``.

The default value is ``false`` so unless you send this field in the
request as ``true``, the payment proceeds with the default scheme.

[#PPv2_SEPADirectDebit_PostProcessing]
=== Post-Processing Operations 
 
{payment-page-v2-abbr} is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post-processing operation - such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions 
- use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

WARNING: A direct refund through {payment-page-v2-abbr} is not possible for _SEPA Direct Debit_ so you have to
obtain your consumer's banking information and send the refund using
_SEPA Credit Transfer_. +
Check the REST API <<SEPACreditTransfer, _SEPA Credit Transfer_ specification>> for details on
_SEPA Direct Debit_ specific post-processing operations.
