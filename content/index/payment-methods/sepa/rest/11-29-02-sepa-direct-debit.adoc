[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Recurring]
==== Recurring Transaction

The {payment-gateway} allows a merchant to submit
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring, recurring transactions>>
for _SEPA Direct Debit_ transactions.

To submit a recurring transaction, the merchant must submit a request
with the transaction type ``debit`` or ``pending-debit`` including a
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Periodic, PERIODIC TYPE>> and a
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Sequence, SEQUENCE TYPE>> element.

[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Recurring_Restrictions]
.Restrictions

Read which <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Restrictions, general restrictions>> have to be met to use a recurring transaction.

Additionally to the general restrictions, _SEPA Direct Debit_ recurring
transactions must meet the following restrictions:

- _Account Holder IBAN_, _Account Holder BIC_, _Account Holder Name_, _Creditor ID_, _Mandate ID_, and _Mandate Signature Date_ must be
the same for ``recurring`` and ``final`` transactions as was provided in the
``first`` transaction.

//-

The following figure describes a possible flow of sequence types:
image:images/11-29-02-sepa-direct-debit/SEPA_Sequence_Type.png[SEPA Sequence Type]

[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Recurring_Restrictions_ReferencingFirst]
*Referencing to a "FIRST" Recurring Transaction*

You must reference a pending-debit with sequence type
``recurring`` or ``final`` to an already existing pending-debit with
sequence type ``first``.

This is done by entering the ``transaction-id`` of the ``first`` transaction
into the ``parent-transaction-id`` field within the ``recurring`` or ``final``
pending-debit request.

This results in the following:

- Transactions will be referenced to each other and considered as part
of the same group of transactions.
- Fields provided in the first pending-debit will be copied into the
recurring or final pending-debit.

//-

If you do not want any information to be copied, the
information must be completely re-submitted as required for a regular
``pending-debit`` request.

You may specify a new value for a field in a recurring or
final pending-debit. However, the rest of the fields will still be
copied from the first ``pending-debit``.

[NOTE]
====
There are exceptions to this point above.

If you specify a new value within any of the following
sections for a recurring or final pending-debit, the information
previously submitted for any of the fields within this section in the
first pending-debit will NOT be copied:

- bank account
- payment methods
- shipping
- mandate

//-
====

[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Recurring_Restrictions_AllFields]
*All Fields Copied*

If _Account Holder First Name_, _Account Holder Last Name_, and _Account Holder Gender_
are provided in the "first" transaction and a new
_Account Holder First Name_ is sent in the "recurring" or "final"
transaction without an _Account Holder Last Name_ and _Gender_, these
fields will be copied from the "first" transaction.

[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Recurring_DueDate]
.Due Date Calculation

The due date calculation of a recurring transaction is the same as for
one-off transactions. Please refer to
<<SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_DueDate, Due Date>>,
which defines how to calculate a due date for each sequence type.

[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Authorization]
==== authorization

{payment-gateway} allows you to submit authorization transactions for _SEPA Direct Debit_ payments.

To submit an authorization transaction, you must submit a
request with ``transaction-type`` ``authorization`` and ``payment-method@name`` ``sepadirectdebit``.

The ``authorization`` transaction type is not mandatory to use for _SEPA Direct Debit_ transactions. A transaction with type ``authorization`` is
not sent on for further processing to the provider. It remains in the
{payment-gateway} for future reference.

If you send a transaction request with transaction type
``authorization``, you receive a ``transaction-id`` in the response
which can be used to reference future ``pending-debit`` transactions.

A few reasons, among others, you may decide to use the
authorization transaction are the following:

- to split a payment into two or more debits referencing one original
authorization.
- to validate an end-customer's banking details before sending in a
``pending-debit`` at a different time.

//-

[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Authorization_Referencing]
.Referencing to an authorization

You can reference a pending-debit to an authorization
by entering the authorization's ``transaction-id`` into the
``parent-transaction-id`` in the ``pending-debit`` request.

This results in the following:

- Transactions are be referenced to each other and considered as part
of the same payment.
- Fields provided in the authorization are copied into the
pending-debit.

//-

If you do not want any information to be copied, the
information must be completely re-submitted as required for a regular
pending-debit request.

You may specify a new value for a field in a pending-debit.
However, the rest of the fields will still be copied from the
authorization.

[NOTE]
====
There are exceptions to this point above.

If you specify  a new value within any of the following
sections for a recurring or final pending-debit, the information
previously submitted for any of the fields within this section in the
authorization will NOT be copied:

- bank account
- payment methods
- shipping
- mandate
//-
====

It is also possible to reference a <<SEPACreditTransfer_TransactionTypes_refund, refund>> to
an authorization if your business flow requires this.

[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Authorization_Referencing_Failed]
.Referencing to a Failed authorization

An authorization is used for the merchant's
purpose only. It is not forwarded to a provider. It aids your business flow or in deciding how to proceed further. When your business flow requires a transaction to be referenced to a
failed authorization transaction, then it is possible to do so.

[#SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Void]
==== void

<<SEPA_TransactionType_Void, SEPA _void_>>
can be used with both SEPA payment methods: _SEPA Credit Transfer_ and _SEPA Direct Debit._

=== Workflow

image::images/diagrams/sepa_direct-debit.svg[SEPA Direct Debit Workflow]

. The transaction type within the request must be ``debit`` or ``pending-debit``.
. If the request is successful, a response will be returned with status
_Success_. This response means that the transaction has entered the
{payment-gateway} successfully. The transaction itself is in ``pending``
status, waiting to be sent to your bank account.
. If the request is not successful, a response will be returned with
status _Failed_. *The response always contains a status code and a description.*
Please read this description carefully as it will help to
understand why the transaction request has failed and what needs to be
fixed in order to send a successful transaction request.
. Once the transaction has been successfully sent to and processed by
the bank, a new transaction with type ``debit`` will be created in status
_Success_. This process usually takes up to 2 business days. The
transaction will then be forwarded the Central Bank for processing.
. If the transaction has been rejected by your bank, a ``debit``
transaction on status _Failed_ will be created and the transaction will
not be sent to the Central Bank.
. You receive a notification of the ``debit`` transaction.

//-

NOTE: Although a transaction has been successfully processed by the merchant's
bank, the transaction may still be reversed by the consumer's bank for
reasons such as insufficient funds, account owner deceased, bank account
closed, etc. In this case, a ``debit-return`` transaction will be created
and matched to the original ``debit`` transaction to ensure you
have a complete overview for your debtor management. For a full list of
debit-return reasons, please refer to the list of  <<SEPA_ReturnCodes, SEPA Return Codes>>.

You can request the status of the transaction at any time by sending a "<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID, Retrieve Transaction by Transaction ID>>".

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields]
=== Fields

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_DirectDebit]
==== Direct Debit

The fields used for _SEPA Direct Debit_ requests, responses and
notifications are the same as the REST API Fields. Please refer to the
<<RestApi_Fields, REST API fields>> or the request example for the fields required in a direct debit transaction.

Only the fields listed below have different properties.

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_Authorization]
==== authorization

The fields used for authorization requests, responses and
notifications are the same as the REST API Fields. Please refer to the <<RestApi_Fields, REST API fields>> or the request example for the fields required in an authorization transaction.

[NOTE]
====
Some of the elements that are mandatory for a _SEPA Direct Debit_
transaction are not mandatory for a SEPA authorization transaction. +

For example, IBAN and BIC are optional. If you require IBAN
and BIC to be validated, they *must* be sent in the request. If they are
sent within the request, the system validates their formal correctness.
====

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields]
==== SEPA Direct Debit Specific Fields

The following elements should be kept in mind when sending in a _SEPA Direct Debit_ payment request:

- Creditor ID or Creditor Identifier
- Mandate ID
- Mandate Signature Date
- Provider Transaction Reference ID
- Due Date

//-

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_CreditorID]
.Creditor ID

The creditor ID is a mandatory identifier for each Merchant who wants to
perform _SEPA Direct Debits._ Depending on the originating country, the
merchant may need to apply for the creditor ID at a tax office, local
authority, or another organization. The format for the ID is not unique. +
In order to be able to offer _SEPA Direct Debit_ as a payment method, you must apply for a Creditor Identifier. The Creditor ID identifies a merchant and allows consumers to be able to manage their mandates with merchants more easily. +
This strongly depends on the local rules and regulations.

The current validation of the creditor ID follows the rule of the
'European Payment Council' based on Document 'EPC260-08 Creditor
Identifier Overview v4.0'. +

The countries currently validated by the {payment-gateway} are
the following: DE, AT, NL, CH, LI, GB. +
The remaining countries mentioned in the documentation are currently not
validated.

For more Details please see the official page of the 'European Payment
Council': https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/guidance-documents/creditor-identifier-overview

The following characters are allowed:
[``a-zA-Z``]\{2,2}[``0-9``]\{2,2}[``a-zA-Z0-9``]\{3,3}[``a-zA-Z0-9``]\{1,28}

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_CreditorID_ErrorMessages]
*Error Messages in case of an incorrectly submitted Creditor ID*:

For detailed information concerning the error code, refer to <<StatusCodes, Status Codes and Transaction Statuses>>.

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_MandateID]
.Mandate ID

A two-party mandate between the merchant and the debtor is required for
_SEPA Direct Debit_ payments. The mandate is an agreement giving the
merchant permission to debit the consumer's account for the sum upon
which the two parties agreed. Every mandate has an ID provided by the
merchant that, when combined with the Creditor ID, creates a unique
mandate ID. This mandate reference must be sent to the {payment-gateway} within the request.

NOTE: The mandate ID may *not* be generated by the {payment-gateway}.
It is solely the responsibility of the merchant.

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_MandateSignatureDate]
.Mandate Signature Date

This is the date on which the above-mentioned mandate was signed by the
consumer.

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_ProviderTransactionReferenceID]
.Provider Transaction Reference ID

This ID provides a reference for the complete end-to-end lifecycle of a
_SEPA Direct Debit_ transaction. It is used as a reference within the
banking system to ensure all transactions referencing each other (e.g. a
direct debit and a debit return) are matched and that the complete
lifecycle of a payment is identifiable. {payment-provider-name} generates this ID for you.

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_DueDate]
.Due Date

The due date is the day when the funds will be cleared on the debtors
bank account. {payment-provider-name} can calculate the best (earliest) due date for
the Merchant. When the Due Date field in the request is left empty,
{payment-provider-name} will calculate the due date for the merchant automatically.

The merchant may, however, send in a due date inside the request if a
specific date is requested. This date may only be used if it passes
validation. If validation is not passed, {payment-provider-name} will return a failed
transaction and the transaction must be re-submitted.

WARNING: {payment-provider-name} cannot replace an incorrect due date sent in by the merchant
with a correct due date calculated by the system as this would change
the content of the transaction sent in by the merchant.

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_DueDate_DueDateCalculation]
*Calculating the Due Date*

In order to keep processing times transparent for all transactions
within SEPA, a transaction's due date has been clearly defined. If the
merchant chooses to specify a due date, it is important to ensure all
payments are submitted on time and are processed correctly. {payment-provider-name}
requires you to submit

- all transactions, regardless of sequence type, at least three (3)
banking days before the due date.

//-

[NOTE]
====
This is not a requirement. It is an option. If you choose to
send in a transaction later than the earliest possible due date, this is
possible. {payment-provider-name} will always validate a due date if one is sent in
with the transaction request.

The transaction request must be received by the {payment-gateway} no
earlier than 14 calendar days before the due date.

It is also necessary for you to take into consideration the
European Central Bank's Target 2 Calendar which specifies all
non-banking days. These include:

- Saturdays and Sundays
- New Year's Day
- Good Friday
- Easter Monday
- 1 May (Labour Day)
- Christmas Day
- 26 December

//-

read chapter <<SEPADirectDebit_TransactionTypes_Recurring, SEPA Direct Debit Recurring Transaction>>.

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_DelayedProcessing]
.Delayed processing of SEPA _Direct Debit_ transactions

{payment-provider-name} offers the possibility to delay the processing of a _SEPA Direct Debit_ transaction by providing the element ``payment/capture-date``.

inside the _SEPA Direct Debit_ request.

According to the date which is provided in the request the corresponding
SEPA transaction will be sent to the {payment-provider-name} bank for processing.
This feature enables the merchant to cancel the transaction before the
cut-off time of the capture date. The capture date range is from 1-14
calendar days. Dates outside of this range lead to a transaction
rejection with the status code 400.1321. If the capture date is a
non-working bank day, the processing will start on the next bank working
day. For example, if the capture date is pointing to a Saturday, the
transaction processing will start on next Monday.

The capture date influences the validation rule and the calculation
logic of the due date. The due date is validated and calculated
according to the same rules as described in the chapter 'Due Date' but
starting from the capture date. For example, if the capture date is the
Tuesday 25.11.2015, the next possible due date for the one-off
transaction is 25.11.2015  + 1 bank working day = Friday 26.11.2015.

The due date may only be used if it passes validation. If validation is
not passed, {payment-provider-name} returns a failed transaction (400.1175) and the
transaction must be re-submitted.

NOTE: The provided capture date does not guarantee the money flow on this
date. The real money flow will occur according to the provided or
calculated due date.

[#SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_B2B]
.B2B

B2B (B2B SDD) is an optional field. It is a business-to-business scheme,
intended solely for use of debtors that are professionals or companies.

Private individuals (consumers) or micro enterprises use B2C (Core SDD)
instead.
