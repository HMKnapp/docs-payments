== Instant Payment Notification

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Introduction]

The {payment-gateway} has a built-in _notification_ capability.
An _Instant Payment Notification_ (IPN) informs the merchant about the
final status of a transaction.

Type of notifications: *HTTP(S)* (Web Server POST)

The following formats are currently supported:

- application/xml
- application/json
//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Configuration]
=== Configuration

To receive a notification, you have to include the notifications element with an email address or a URL into your transaction request.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Json]
==== Request a Notification in JSON Format

The following example shows how the {payment-gateway} can be
configured to send notifications as JSON format:

``<notifications format="application/json>``


.XML Request (determines notification in JSON format)

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/generic_debit_notification__96ffdc.xml[]
----

The notification will look like this:

.JSON Notification

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Json_JSON_Notification.json[]
----

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Xml]
==== Request a Notification in XML Format

``<notifications format="application/xml">``


.Notification in XML Format
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/creditcard_purchase_notification_.xml[]
----

It is possible to set up conditional notifications based on the state of
the transaction.  For example, it is possible to instruct a notification
to only occur on 'failed' or 'successful' transactions.

[cols="10,10,10,10,50"]
|===
|Notification Type  | Notification Tag in Request     | Possible Extensions of URL  | Ports         | Possible Extensions of ``transaction-state``

|HTTP(S)            | ``URL``, ``transaction-state``  | any configured URL          | 80, 443, 5500 | if _URL_ <> empty and _`transaction-state`_ = empty all notifications go to that URL or if _URL_ <> empty and _`transaction-state`_ <> empty depending on the _transaction-state_ (success, failed, in-progress, etc) the notification goes to the corresponding _URL_.
|===



A request, which defines a URL to be used, when the payment process will fail:

.XML Request with different URL for failed transactions
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/generic_debit_request__edeec5.xml[]
----

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_NotificationExamples]
==== Notification Examples

.Credit Card Payment
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_NotificationExamples_CreditCardPayment.xml[]
----

.Alternative Payment Methods
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/generic_debit_notification__596c76.xml[]
----

NOTE: Note that the "amount" value for some alternative payment notifications
contains 6 minor digits.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Content]
=== Notification Content

The content of the notification depends on the status of the response
{payment-gateway} receives from the provider.

|===
|{payment-gateway-abbr} receives... |{payment-gateway-abbr} sends notification:...

|a successful response
|_Success_ <<StatusCodes, Return Code and Transaction Status>>

|a failure response
|_Failure_ <<StatusCodes, Return Code and Transaction Status>>

|a timeout from provider |_Failure_ with error code (e.g. 500.1051)

|no info from provider |_Failure_ with error code 500.1052, if {payment-gateway-abbr} runs
in its internal timeout
|===

Credit Card IPNs are not encoded and non Credit Card IPNs are mostly
Base64 encoded, but there are variations possible. The variations depend
on the payment methods.

For each notification type it is possible to add more than one
recipient. Copy the tag and add a different URL.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Transaction]
==== Notification Transaction Type

Depending on the selected payment method, the transaction type in the notification may differ from the one sent in the request. For example, a _pending-debit_ request may result in a _debit-return_ notification, or an _authorization_ request may result in a _deposit_ notification. +

NOTE: Credit card transactions: The ``transaction-id`` indicates which request/response and notification belong together. +
Alternative payment method transactions: Compare the ``transaction-id`` of the response with the ``parent-transaction-id`` of the notification.


[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Delay]
=== Notification Delay

In some cases the {payment-gateway} ({payment-gateway-abbr}) may send a delayed
IPN.

This may occur due to one of the following reasons:

- Some payment method providers have longer processing periods than
others
- Communication delays caused by:
* downtime of the provider's system
* a workflow which has a fixed waiting time, at the {payment-gateway} as well as the provider.
* the merchant has sent an incorrect ID. In that case {payment-gateway} will send a 404 message, stating that the transaction is not
available.
