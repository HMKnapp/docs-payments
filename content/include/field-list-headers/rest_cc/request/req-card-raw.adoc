``card-raw`` is a child of <<{listname}_request_card, payment.card>>. +

``card-raw`` data is used, when the consumer uses a mobile device in a card present payment process. +
For mobile device initiated transactions, there is typically a backend server that integrates to the {payment-gateway} for payment transactions processing. This is to ensure that the credentials connecting to the gateway are not published in mass consumer devices.

NOTE: If ``card-raw.data`` is submitted, all the other ``card-raw`` fields below are mandatory.
