[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RedirectURL]
== Redirect URL

A payment process needs a redirect URL. If no redirect URL is defined at
all, the transaction will not be processed.

You can send a redirect URL in case of a successful, a
cancelled or a failed transaction. Depending on the result of the
transaction, the consumer will be redirected to the corresponding page of
your environment.

The redirect URLs can be configured either on MAID level or they can be
sent individually with each request.

If you configure the redirect URLs in the MAID, they don't
have to be present in the request. The redirect URLs are automatically
loaded from your MAID configuration.

If you specify the redirect URLs in the request, the
request's redirect URLs overwrite the MAID configuration for that
particular transaction.

You can specify up to three different redirect URLs in one request.
In that case you can specify one success-URL, one for failure and
one cancellation-URL.
