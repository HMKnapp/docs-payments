[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ReferencingTransaction]
=== Referencing a Transaction

With the {payment-gateway} a payment process can reference two
subsequent transactions.

This reference can be accomplished with the transaction ID.


//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ReferencingTransaction_byID]
==== Referencing by Transaction ID

Referencing by transaction ID uses the field <``parent-transaction-id``>.

In that case the <``transaction-id``> of the preceding transaction will be
referenced as the <``parent-transaction-id``> of the follow up transaction.

Be aware that the ``parent-transaction-id`` is also referred to as
``reference-transaction-id``.

The following example for PayPal shows the use of
<``parent-transaction-id``>:

|etc |void-authorization |6789012 |8901235

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring]
=== Recurring Transaction

A recurring transaction is a repetitive set of transactions. In general
the recurrence occurs on a regular basis (e.g. paying annual fees for an
insurance). A <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_ReferencingTransaction, reference to such a transaction>>
always means that the subsequent transaction has
a functional dependency on the preceding transaction.

This could be, for example, a repeating transaction in a standard
transaction workflow which occurs on a regular schedule.

To submit a recurring transaction, the merchant must submit a request
with a specific transaction type. It depends on the payment method,
which transaction types apply. Currently the {payment-gateway}
supports recurring transactions with the payment methods <<CreditCard, Credit Card>>, <<API_PaymentMethods_PayPal, PayPal>>, and <<SEPA>>.
To use recurring transactions, the request must provide the corresponding PERIODIC TYPE and a SEQUENCE TYPE.
[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Periodic]
==== The Periodic Type

The *PERIODIC TYPE* element is chosen specifically by the merchant and
depends on the merchant's business model. One of the following two
periodic types must be chosen:

- *_installment_:* one in a set that completes a financial transaction
and
- *_recurring_*: one in a set that occurs repeatedly, such as a
subscription.

//-

Both transactions will be processed the same way.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Sequence]
==== The Sequence Type

Additionally, the sub-element *SEQUENCE TYPE* with one of the following
sequences must be submitted:

- *_first_*: The first transaction in a series of recurring transactions
- *_recurring_*: A transaction that is part of a series of recurring
transactions.
- *_final_*: The final transaction in a series of recurring
transactions. A payment with this sequence type completes a chain of
recurring payments.

//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Restrictions]
==== Restrictions

To ensure proper processing, please take into consideration the
following restrictions:

- _Recurring_ and _final_ transactions are required to be matched to
the _first_ transaction.
- A request with sequence type _first_ may only contain a
parent-transaction ID referring to another transaction which has been
submitted without a periodic type.
- A _recurring_ or _final_ transaction may only be referenced to a
parent _first_ if it is on status SUCCESS.
- Where a _first_ transaction has been voided, a
subsequent _recurring_ or _final_ transaction will not be accepted.
- After a transaction with sequence type _final_ has been submitted, it
is not possible to submit another _recurring_ or _final_ transaction for
this series.
- Only one periodic type may be used for the complete series of
recurring payments. This means that the periodic type in a subsequent
transaction must match the periodic type sent in the _first_ request.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction]
=== Retrieve a Transaction

The {payment-gateway} allows the merchant to submit payment
transactions, as well as search for payments and merchant data. 

In the standard process, the merchant is informed via <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, IPN>>
about the status of a submitted transaction. _Retrieve Transaction_ is
an option for the merchant to find out the status of a transaction, if,
for some reason, the IPN has not been received. Lacking an IPN can
happen due to the fact that the transaction has not reached its final
status or additional information from providers are not present at the
point of time the _Retrieve_ query was sent. So in case the notification
was sent the status is final.

There are <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Delay, several reasons>>
why _Retrieve Transaction_ shall not be launched immediately
after submitting a transaction and still waiting for the IPN.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID]
==== Retrieve Transaction by Transaction-ID

Retrieving a transaction using a _Transaction-ID_ returns a single
transaction belonging to a merchant account. The _Transaction-ID_
attribute must match the value that was included in the transaction
response sent by {payment-provider-name}. An error occurs if the _Transaction-ID_ is
not available (request must be submitted later again) or the requested
user is not authorized to see the content. The desired content type can
be set through the _Accept_-header or by specifying an extension.

The <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Notification file (IPN)>> the merchant gets (based on configuration), is the standard
process to gather information about a submitted transaction. The reason
for this is that it could happen that the transaction has not reached
final status or additional information from providers are not present at
the point of time the _Retrieve_ query was sent. So in case the
notification was sent the status is final.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID_Response]
.Response when retrieving a transaction

The response corresponds to the transaction type of the transaction
being retrieved. For example, the transaction type = 'purchase' and the
transaction type = 'tokenize' have different responses when the
transaction is being created and that same response will occur for this
retrieval. See the sample responses as described for each transaction
type.



[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Storing]
=== Storing Additional Data

In addition to processing transactions, {payment-gateway} also
permits the storage and later retrieval of additional information.

The use of  the header "custom-field" permits the client application to
store key-value pairs with each transaction.


In the following example, the client application has stored a _purchase order_,
_invoice_, _crm-id_, _customer-tier_ and _promotional-code_.

This information is also echoed back in any response querying the status
of a transaction.  It is also possible to see this information in the
reporting system.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_CheckSignatureAuthorization]
==== _check-signature/authorization_

_check-signature_ and its related transaction types are transaction
types that are dependent on the payment method not of elementary need for
processing via {payment-gateway}. Some payment methods just
provide the possibility to verify if this payment method is allowed to
process by this consumer account or to verify if the account data are
valid. In _{enterprise-portal-abbr}_ both Transaction Types are visible.   

[NOTE]
====
.Example
For <<Sofort>> the transaction type _check-signature_ can be submitted to validate the
digital signature.
